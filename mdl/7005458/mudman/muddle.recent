6 March 1979 (PDL, TAA)

The SUBRs LSH and ROT have been added, a la Lisp.

MUDDLE 55		21 November 1978 (btb, clr, lim, pdl, taa)

Note:  there have been significant changes in the preloaded packages for
MUDDLE 55.  Consult MUDMAN;PRELOD RECENT for details.  Not all of the
changes are upward-compatible.

1) I/O system

	Six-character device names can be used in muddle 55.  This
allows one to use things like the DIRHNG device, which previously could
only be accessed via hand-coded routines.
	'Unknown' devices (devices that no one has put special code into
muddle for:  'known' devices include STY, TTY, and USR) are now assumed
to act like the DSK device.  On ITS this mainly fixes some lingering
bugs with things like the MLARC device; on TOPS-20, when muddle 105 is
created, this will be much more reasonable for things like PS:, SYS:,
and other logical names.

	The SUBR FILE-EXISTS? can be used to test the existence of a
file without creating a channel (70-140 words of garbage).  It takes
file name arguments just like OPEN, with the same defaults, and returns
either T or a FALSE.  The false has two elements:  the first is a string
describing the error; the second is the numerical error code obtained
from the system.  Thus:

	<FILE-EXISTS? "TAA;TAA LOGIN">
T
	<FILE-EXISTS? "TAA;ZORK FEEP">
#FALSE ("FILE NOT FOUND" 1048576)

	The TTY output channel normally is not in display mode.  This
means that IOC errors will rarely occur when one is typing in strings
containing ctrl-P's; however, if you have hand-coded routines that
expect display mode to be on, they will no longer work.  This can be
corrected by doing a .CALL IOT and supplying the display mode bit
(%TJDIS, 4000 octal) as a control argument.  PRINC of a string causes
the display bit to be turned on temporarily, for the benefit of things
like the BUF package.

2) OFFSETs

	OFFSETs are essentially FIXes with DECLs attached--they allow
you to specify the type of structure an offset refers to.  If used
properly, this can make debugging considerably easier; it will
eventually also help the compiler generate more efficient code.  At
present the compiler knows nothing about them, so don't complain if you
lose.
	The SUBR OFFSET takes two arguments, a FIX and a DECL, and
returns an object of TYPE OFFSET (the PRIMTYPE of an OFFSET is also
OFFSET).  An offset may be given as an argument to NTH and PUT, just
like a FIX; it may also be applied to arguments.  The only difference is
that the structure you're referring to must match the DECL contained in
the OFFSET, or an error will result.  Thus:
	<SETG FOO <OFFSET 1 '<CHANNEL FIX>>>
%<OFFSET 1 '<CHANNEL FIX>>
; Note that the DECL must be quoted if it's a form, since OFFSET is a
; SUBR.
	<FOO ,INCHAN>
1
	<FOO <ROOT>>
*ERROR*
ARG-WRONG-TYPE
NTH
LISTENING-AT-LEVEL 2 PROCESS 1

	Note:  when the compiler gets around to understanding OFFSETs,
it will not do the right thing with them unless they are MANIFEST. 
Since there's no good reason not to manifest them, this isn't a problem.

The SUBR INDEX, given an OFFSET, returns the FIX:
	<INDEX ,FOO>
1

The SUBRs GET-DECL and PUT-DECL have been modified so they can be used
for manipulating OFFSETs.  GET-DECL of an OFFSET returns the associated
DECL; PUT-DECL of an OFFSET and a DECL returns a new OFFSET with the
same INDEX as the argument, but with a new DECL:
	<GET-DECL ,FOO>
<CHANNEL FIX>
	<PUT-DECL ,FOO OBLIST>
%<OFFSET 1 OBLIST>
	,FOO
%<OFFSET 1 '<CHANNEL FIX>>

An OFFSET is not a structured object, as this should make clear.

	A note to hackers:  OFFSETs are stored as single words, with the
INDEX in the right half and the DECL in the left half.  Since the DECL
can be either an ATOM or a FORM, the pointer is really a pointer to a
list cell, which points to the actual DECL.  This is not as
space-efficient as it might be.  As a special hack, ANY is recognized as
a special case:  if it is given as the DECL, then the DECL pointer is 0
and no list cell is created.  Thus, if you're making the final version
of your system and want to bum some storage, you can do something like
<SETG FOO <PUT-DECL ,FOO ANY>> for all OFFSETs.


3) PUT

	In muddle 55, one may apply a FIX (or an OFFSET) to two
arguments, in which case it turns into PUT.  This is analogous to the
one-argument case, which turns into NTH.  Note that the compiler has
not yet been taught about this, either; when it is, the PUT will
unambiguously be a PUT into a structure rather than a PUTPROP.


4) Garbage collector

	A mark-sweep garbage collector exists.  It is never used in the
normal case, but some users may find it desirable to use it in some
cases.  The mark-sweep garbage collector does no compaction (and no
copying); therefore, it uses considerably less CPU time than the normal
garbage collector.  Also, its paging behavior is arbitrarily superior. 
However, it will not cause your core image to shrink:  garbage is put on
free lists, and recycled by muddle's various structure builders.
	This can prove useful in a system (such as the compiler) where
the size of the core image rarely changes, but where structure is being
created and thrown away continuously.  No tests have been run, but use
of the mark-sweep garbage collector is expected to save a fair amount of
time in some situations.
	You can cause it to be used by supplying the optional third
argument to GC:
	<GC 0 T 10>
says to mark-sweep 10 times between uses of the full-copy garbage
collector.  0 means never use SGC; <MIN> means always use it.
	When the mark-sweep garbage collector is invoked with GC-MON on,
it prints MSGIN ... MSGOUT rather than GIN ... GOUT.  Note that only
free-storage garbage collects can use it:  since relocation does not
happen, GC's for things like PDL overflow must use the 'real' garbage
collector.


5) Internals

	For those of you who write assembly language routines, or who
debug compiler output, the following:  if an illegal uuo occurs, the JPC
will be saved in the location SAVJPC.  This will point to the last jump
(POPJ, PUSHJ, JRST, etc.) executed, which is frequently more useful than
the location of the losing UUO.  In MUDDLE 54, the UUO handler does a
JRST before deciding whether a UUO is legal, so the JPC always points to
an uninteresting location.


6) R.I.P.

	The SUBRs DISPLAY, ERASE, FREE, and STORE have gone west.  No
funeral arrangements have been announced.
	For hysterical reasons, the type STORAGE continues to exist, as
does the SUBR ISTORAGE.


MUDDLE 54 January 27, 1977 (clr & btb)

	MUDDLE 54 contains only upward compatible changes.
The major change to MUDDLE 54 is the fact that the garbage collector
does not reside in the users core image unless it is being used.  This
change should be invisible (ha, ha) except that there will be more
address space available to user programs and data structures.  The
other additions to MUDDLE are listed below.

1)	^S

	There has been a minor change made in how the ^S handler
finds the frame to go back to.   Previously, it looked down the
stack for the nearest LISTEN or ERROR frame and returned to that.
Now it uses the current binding of LERR\ !-INTERRUPTS to find
the appropriate frame.

2)	!\

	An object of type CHARACTER may now be typed in as either
!" or !\ followed by the character.  The output is always !\
followed by the character.  This was done to make realtime TECO
users happy.

3)	Byte Strings

	There is a new data type called BYTES that is a string
of uniformly sized bytes.  The bytes may be any size between 1
and 36 bits.  Two new SUBRs exist associated with byte strings.
BYTES takes one required argument which is a FIX specifying a
byte size and any number of PRIMTYPE words.  It returns an
object of type BYTES of that byte size containing the objects
of PRIMTYPE word as elements.  These objects will be anded
with the appropriate mask to fit in the byte size.  IBYTES
takes two required fixes and one optional argument.  It
uses the first fix to specify a byte size  and other than that
behaves like ISTRING, IUVECTOR etc.  The elements of a byte
string are always of type FIX.  Other than that, they look
very similar to STRINGs including the unfortunate requirement
of deferred pointers.  Byte string may also be input in the
following format:

	#n {b1 b2 b3 ... bm}

where n is the byte size and b1 ... bm are m bytes.  A special
DECL also exists for byte strings.  It has the following format:

	<BYTES n m>

This decls a byte string of n-bit bytes of minimum length m.

4)	I/O Changes

	If OPEN, OPEN-NR or CHANNEL are passed four strings (name1, name2,
device and sname) as an argument, it will open exactly the file specified
without any attempt to parse the strings.

	Many I/O subroutines and interrupt handlers indicate errors by
returning FALSE with a string indicating the error.  This has been improved
to have a three element FALSE with one error string, the file name as
a string and a number which is the system I/O status word.  Currently
the RENAME SUBR is an exception, it returns a two element false
containing the error string and the status.

5)	DECL additions.

	Besides the change to DECLs to handle byte strings, two other
changes have been made.  The default DECL for structures if no
REST clause is specified is that there can any number of additional
elements of any type.  If the structure DECL is specified in an object of
type SEGMENT instead of FORM, it means that this an exact size specification.
For example:

	#DECL ((X) !<LIST FIX FIX>)

This declares X to be a LIST of exactly 2 FIXES whereas:

	#DECL ((X) <LIST FIX FIX>)

declares X to be LIST containing at least two FIXes.  The other DECL
change is concerned with optional elements in a structure DECL.  If instead
of REST or a fix in the first element of a vector in a decl, either the
atom OPT or OPTIONAL is found, it means the types specified in the vector
can be there but aren't required.

6)	SPECIAL/UNSPECIAL

	Interpreter SPECIAL/UNSPECIAL handling has been improved to more
closely reflect the behavior of compiled code.

7)	"OPT"

	The string "OPT" can now be used in place of "OPTIONAL" in arg
lists of functions and rsubrs.

8)	BIND

	A new FSUBR, BIND, exists.  It is identical to PROG except that it
does not bind LPROG\ !-INTERRUPTS and therefore RETURNs and AGAINS will
not default to it.  This could prove useful to MACRO writers.

9)	L-INS and L-OUTS

	If the atom L-INS has a value and it is a LIST, it will be used
as a ring-buffer of objects typed into the READ/EVAL/PRINT loop.  The
most recent object will be at the front of the LIST and the oldest at
the end.  The user can decide how much to save based on the length of
the LIST.  Do not make the list circular!  L-OUTS performs a similar
feat for values returned from the EVAL.  LAST-OUT still exists as
before.


MUDDLE 53 (addition) August 26, 1976 (clr)

	A change to MAPF/MAPR has been installed in the current MUDDLE.
MAPF or MAPR may now take only two arguments.  In this case the iteration
function is applied to no arguments each time and the mapping continues
indefinitely until either a MAPLEAVE or MAPSTOP is invoked.  This feature
gives MAPF and MAPR all the features of STACKFORM which we hope to phase
out.

Example:

	<DEFINE LNUM (X) #DECL ((X) FIX)
		<MAPF ,LIST <FUNCTION () <COND (<0? <SET X <- .X 1>>> <MAPSTOP 0>)
					      (ELSE .X)>>>>

The above function returns a LIST of the numbers from its arg minus
1 to 0.



MUDDLE 53 (clr & btb) April 28, 1976

	MUDDLE version 53 has been released as NMUDDL.  Once again, there
are no major changes and the small changes should generally be
compatible.

1)	New Pure Fbin implementation.

	The FBIN mapping mechanism has been rewritten to get around
the ITS directory size limitations, avoid using the archive device and
allow for some reasonable garbage collection of the pure files.  These
features should have no impact on current programs except that a new
PDUMP for MUD53 will be released soon.  WARNING:  After the new PDUMP
is released, it will be inadvisable to edit FBIN files in any way.

2)	New Interrupts

	A new interrupt has been implemented for TTY output channels.
If a "CHAR" interrupt is setup for a TTY output channel, it will be triggered
every time a line feed is output and whenever the system generates a MORE
interrupt.  The handling function should take one or two arguments.  If two
arguments are supplied to the handling function, it is a line feed interrupt
and the first arg is the line number and the second is the channel.  If
only one argument is supplied, it is a MORE interrupt and the argument is the
channel.

3)	IMAGE

	IMAGE now has an internal entry and it should not fool
around with other TTY bits when it is used.

4)	GC-DUMP

	GC-DUMP will now dump purified structures.

5)	New DECL feature.

	If an atom used in a DECL is not a type name or a special decl atom
(STRUCTURED, ANY etc.), the DECL checker will attempt to do a GET on the
atom and DECL and use the result.

6)	PDL overflow features

	A PDL overflow buffer exhausted is no longer a fatal error.
It is just a MUDDLE error.

7)	SUBSTRUC

	SUBSTRUC of a large string should no longer lose.

8)	Alt Mode Rubout

	In many but not all cases, it is now possible to rub out the
alt mode typed in if you are typeing to READ and you have not closed
your expression.

9)	STRING Uniformity

	Byte pointers to STRINGs are now uniform such that pointers
to the same string are always ==?.

10)	MUDDLE Oblist

	The MUDDLE oblist has been almost completely thrown away.
The compiler and assembler will be updated not to need it.


MUDDLE 52 (btb, bkd & clr)  December 12, 1975

	MUDDLE version 52 has been released as NMUDDL.  There are no
earth shattering new features, but there are many small changes, most
of which should be compatible.

1)	VALID-TYPE?

	A new SUBR called VALID-TYPE? has been added.  It takes one
argument which must be an atom and returns #FALSE () if this atom is
not a type name or TYPE-C of the atom if it is.  Also a change has been
made to permit the interpeter to go from a type name to a type code
much faster than before.

2)	QCALL

	A new faster call UUO has been implemented.  Unfortunately the
speedup is not as much as we had hoped.  Calls to RSUBRs are about
30% faster and calls to RSUBR-ENTRYs are about 50% faster.  This UUO
will be generated by forthcoming versions of the compiler.

3)	EVALTYPE, APPLYTYPE and PRINTTYPE CHANGES

	Any of the above SUBRs may be applied to one argument, a type
name, and they will return either:

	a)	#FALSE ()	--	meaning this type's EVALTYPE etc.
					is in its initial state.

	b)	another TYPE	--	meaning this type's EVALTYPE etc.
					is the same as that of the returned 
					type in an initial MUDDLE.

	c)	applicable obj	--	meaning this is the EVALTYPE etc.
					function.

	Also if the second arg to EVALTYPE is ,EVAL or the second arg to
APPLYTYPE is ,APPLY or the second arg to PRINTTYPE is ,PRINT, the appropriate
xTYPE will be reset to its initial state.

4)	PURIFY

	PURIFY now takes a TUPLE of arguments and purifies all of them.
It along with GC-DUMP attempts to be more specific when it gives the
famous STRUCTURE-CONTAINS-UNDUMPABLE-TYPE error.

5)	SPNAME

	This SUBR is identical to PNAME except that it returns a STRING
that shares with the ATOM's pname.  PUTting into such a STRING will cause
an ERROR.

6)	CRLF

	This SUBR is identical to TERPRI except that it returns T instead
of #FALSE ().

7)	FAST SUBSYSTEM

	A method of subsystem startup has been implemented that goes
directly to RESTORE without going through an INIT file.  Just answer the
appropriate questions to SUBSYS MAKER to win.

8)	GC SPEED UP

	Parts of the garbage collector have been rewritten to be faster.
This combined with purification of the preloaded RSUBRs makes garbage
collection of an initial MUDDLE about twice as fast as in MUDDLE 51.

9)	GC-MON, RSUBR-LINK, DECL-CHECK AND OVERFLOW

	In an attempt to bring about uniformity, the above SUBRs now
all behave in the same way.  Calling them with no arguments returns
the current state.  Calling them with one argument sets the state and
returns the previous state.

10)	CHANNEL RECYCLE

	In previous MUDDLEs, when an attempt to open a file using OPEN failed,
a channel was built and thrown away, generating unnecessary garbage.  This
feature has been fixed so that these dead channels are recycled.  This
should have no effect on user programs, except that they will create less
garbage.

11)	PC-LOSER

	In the hope of ultimately achieving more efficient compiled
code which is also interruptable, a feature has been implemented to
allow a compiled program to run interruptably without worrying about
keeping the types of the items that are in the ACs somewhere or checking
the INTFLG.  This is achieved by telling the interrupt system to back
up to a certain point if the code is restarted from an interrupt.  The
facility is similar to the ITS PC loser concept.

12)	EXPANDED ERROR MESSAGES

	There are now more ERRORs in compiled code to try to be more
specific about the problem.  Also the PC of the ERROR is passed to
ERROR as an aid in debugging.

13)	LARGE UVECTOR DECL CHECK

	DECLs of the form <UVECTOR [REST a-single-type]> will cause the
interpreter to check only the UTYPE of the UVECTOR rather than every
element.

14)	SAVE/FSAVE

	The old SAVE has been removed.  SAVE and FSAVE are now identical.

15)	AND?/OR?

	These are SUBR forms of AND and OR respectively.  They are useful
for the first arguments to MAPF and MAPR.

16)	NEW BLOAT ARGS (PGOOD AND TPGOOD)

	BLOAT now takes two more optional arguments at the end.  They
specify the most desirable size for the auxiliary stack and control
stack respectively.

17)	START ADDRESS FIX

	Doing an "G" to a MUDDLE subsystem no longer causes an illegal
UUO.

18)	SUBSTRUC OF A TUPLE

	SUBSTRUC now takes a TUPLE as its first arg and treats it like
a vector.

19)	TYPE-C and TYPE-W

	Both now automatically do a NEWTYPE instead of getting an ERROR
if the argument is not a type.

20)	1STEP

	A fix allows starting BKD's DEBUGGER from an interrupt.

MUDDLE 51
		July 28,1975 (clr & btb)

	Most changes in MUDDLE 51 are related to the garbage collector.
MUDDLE 51 will have a full copy garbage collector and will work with only
one garbage collected space, rather than the pair and vector spaces used
previously.

	Along with this new garbage collector are changes to SUBRs inter-
facing with it. Major among these are the additions of a dumper and a
purifier.  There is also a new pre-garbage-collect interrupt.

	The dumper is a facility to copy the core image representation
of an object into a file or UVECTOR.  This dumped object in every way
resembles the original (e.g. it preserves sharing).  All MUDDLE objects
can be dumped out with the exclusion of items pointing to the stack
(e.g. FRAMES, ENVIRONMENTS, LOCATIVES to LOCAL and GLOBAL values),
and other internal pointers (e.g. PROCESSES). Also no PURE objects with
the exclusion of atoms may be dumped.  The call to dump is as follows:

		<GC-DUMP <-object-> <-channel or false-> >

	The first argument is the object you wish dumped.  The second
can either be a PRINTB channel or FALSE.  If it is  of type FALSE GC-DUMP
will create a UVECTOR of UTYPE LOSE with the dumped object in it.  In the
case GC-DUMP will return this UVECTOR otherwise it will return the object
given.  Both arguments to GC-DUMP are required.

	Multiple GC-DUMPs to the same file are allowed.

	In order to read-in a GC-DUMPed file you must use GC-READ.
GC-READ's call looks like.

		<GC-READ <-channel-> <-eof-> >

	The first argument must be a READB channel.  The second argument
is an optional end-of-file routine.  If none is provided and an eof
condition occurs the channels eof routine is used.  If GC-READ is successful
it returns the object read-in, otherwise it returns whatever the eof
routine returns.

	The PURIFY subr allows a user to copy a MUDDLE object into MUDDLE's
pure space. Once this is done that object will never be looked at by the
garbage collector.  Also that object can be shared.  PURIFY takes one
argument and this is the object to be purified.  The same restrictions
on objects to GC-DUMP hold for objects to PURIFY. Currently the user
interface to PURIFY RSUBRs is not yet available.  Imformation regarding
the purification of RSUBRs will be released when is is available.  

	FSAVE must be used to save a MUDDLE with purified structure.  If
this is done the purified structure will be saved as well.

	A new pre-garbage-collector interrupt exists to enable defferring
garbage collects to a later time.  If a garbage collect for free storage
which can be deffered is about to occur and the "DIVERT-AGC" interrupt is
enabled, the handler for this interrupt is run. This handler can allocate
storage if it wishes or cause a garbage collect.  If no handler exists or
the handler was not able to satisfy the pending request for free storage
a garbage collect will occur.  A handler for this interrupt is passed two
arguments.  The first is a FIX equal to the number of words requested
and the second is an atom indicating the reason for the request.  A user
can allocate free storage by using BLOAT.

	A minor change has been made to the GC subr.  The subr now takes
two arguments.  The first is the number of words of free storage it should
try to get.  The second argument if given and is non-false will cause a
more comprehensive and time consuming garbage collect which will be able
to recover more garbage than a usual garbage collect can.

	Several changes have been made to the BLOAT subr.
The fredif parameter no longer exists.  Also a new parameter specifying the
minimum space to be used for maping in the pure part of FBINS.
Using this parameter may help avoid the thrashing caused by continual
mapping in and out of the pure part of FBINS.
  
	A new subr OVERFLOW exists.  It may be used to enable and disable
the OVERFLOW error associated with arithmetic subrs (+, -, *, and /).
It is called with one argument.  If the argument is of type FALSE,
the overflow error is disabled otherwise it is enabled (the initial
state is enabled).  OVERFLOW returns T or #FALSE () reflecting its
previous state.

MUDDLE 50	May 29, 1975	(clr & btb)

	Most of the MUDDLE 50 changes are related to the garbage
collector and PRINT.  Only one change reuires changing existing
software and it is related to the "GC" interrupt.

1)	Garbage Collector Changes

	See MUDMAN;GCINFO > for detailed information.

2)	PRINT Changes

	The entire PRINT module has been overhauled.  This includes
PRINT, PRIN1, PRINC, TERPRI, FLATSIZE and UNPARSE.  In the process
PRINTTYPE has been fixed to work in all cases.  None of the PRINT
family of SUBRs now takes a list of channels as an argument.  FLATSIZE
has one new optional argument, namely the radix for number conversion.
Also, PUSHJ entries have been added for all of the SUBRs for the
convenience of compiled and assembled code.  This incudes special
entries for printing string, characters and atoms.  See BTB;CONVEN >
for calling sequences of internal PRINT routines.

3)	SUBSTRUC

	A new SUBR has been added to facilitate the construction of
structures that are composed of sub-parts of existing structures.  A
special case of this would be a SUBSTRING function.  The calling
sequence is:

	<SUBSTRUC <-obj>- <-rest>- <-amount>- <-where-to>- >

where:
	<-obj>-		an object of primtype STRING, LIST, VECTOR or
			UVECTOR

	<-rest>-		number of element from the beginning of the object
			to start getting sub-object (optional -- default=0)

	<=amount>-	number of elements to incude in the new object
			(optional -- default all remaining elements)

	<-where-to>-	an object whose type is the primtype of obj, the
			new object is copied into this one (optional --
			a new object is built)

WARNING_______:  a known bug exists if any sharing exists between <-obj>- and
<-where-to>-.
î
Note:	If <-where-to>- is not supplied, the new object returned never_____
shares with the original object.

Examples:

	in:	<SUBSTRUC (1 2 3)>
	out:	(1 2 3)		; "The entire object is copied."

	in:	<SUBSTRUC [1 2 3 4 5] 1 3>
	out:	[2 3 4]		; "A sub-object is built."

4)	GBOUND? and GLOC

	Prior to the existance of GDECL and MANIFEST, being globally
assigned and globally bound meant the same thing.  Now, however,
giving a gdecl to an atom or making it manifest can cause it to
have a value slot (i.e. be bound) without being assigned.  This
situation necessitated a way of finding out if an atom is globally
bound.  GBOUND? does this.  It takes one arg, an atom, and returns T or
#FALSE ().

	GLOC now takes an optional second arg which if supplied and not
false, causes a value slot to exist if one didn't already.

5)	LAST-OUT

	The atom LAST-OUT is set to the last object returned by EVAL in
the standard LISTEN loop.  This is very useful for recovering a lost
value.

6)	The SUBR EXIT has been removed.

7)	MANIFEST Changes

	REDEFINE now controls whether SETG will complain if an attempt
to change a manifest variable is made.  Also if an attempt to SETG
a manifest variable to its current value is made, SETG will not complain.
(current value means ==? as opposed to =?)

8)	New PUSHJ Entries Added

	The following SUBRS now have PUSHJ entries available:  LOOKUP,
INSERT, REMOVE, ATOM and STRCOMP.

9)	New SUBR OPEN-NR

	Identical to OPEN, except that the reference date of the opened
file is not changed.

MUDDLE 49	March 7, 1975 (bkd & clr)

	Changes have been made to the MUDDLE Reader so that
comments will not be lost on input (even top-level comments).
Also EDIT and PPRINT have been changed so that all comments
will be properly handled on output and none forgotten or lost.
It is important to notice that every comment will be seen
by PPRINT only when the flag QUICKPRINT is set to FALSE.
However since the default setting for QUICKPRINT is T,
(reasonable and faster for debugging and random hacking around)
any "important" use of PPRINT where loss of comments
is not tolerable should be done with QUICKPRINT set to FALSE.
GROUP-DUMP and PPRINF now automatically bind the QUICKPRINT flag
to FALSE while performing their output and will not miss comments.
	Also PPRINT has been rewritten and group-compiled;
and is now about twice as fast as previous versions.


MUDDLE 49	January 8, 1975 (clr)

	Once again there are a substantial number of changes in the new
version of MUDDLE.  As far as I know, none of the new features should
adversely affect existing software.  Among the more interesting features
are a template data structure facility, an UNWINDer, EVAL macros and
SPECIAL/UNSPECIAL checking in the interpreter.

1)	Template Data Structure

	The interpreter can now handle non-standard data formats that
permit tighter bit packing and therefore more efficient space utilization.
Currently no user interface exists for defining these data structures;
therefore, further information will not exist until the user interface
is written.

2)	UNWIND

	UNWIND is an FSUBR that takes 2 forms.  It EVALs the first one,
and, if the EVAL returns normally, the value of the EVAL call is the value
of UNWIND.  If, however, during the EVAL a non-local return attempts
to return below the UNWIND in the stack, the second form is EVALed, its
value is ignored, and the non-local return is completed.  The second form
is evaluated in the environment that was present when the call to UNWIND was
made.  This facility is useful for cleaning up data bases that are in
inconsistent states and closing temporary channels that may be left around.
FLOAD sets up an UNWIND to close its channel if the user attempts to ERRET
without finishing the FLOAD.

3)	EVAL Macros

	EVAL macros provide the convenience of a function without the
overhead of calling and SPECIALs etc.  Basically an EVAL macro acts
like a function, except that it re-evaluates its value.  For example:

	<DEFMAC INC (ATM "OPTIONAL" (N 1))
		 <FORM SET .ATM <FORM + <FORM LVAL .ATM> .N>>>

The above is a macro for incrementing the value of an atom.  If it were
applied as follows:

	<SET X 1>
	<INC X>

the INC would return 2, and X would have the value 2.  This is because
the first evaluation of <INC X> results in <SET X <+ .X 1>>, which does
the above when EVALed.  To avoid strange compilation problems, the first
evaluation of the macro call is done in the top-level environment.
	The macro INC prints out as:

	#MACRO (#FUNCTION (.......))

Obviously DEFMAC is almost the same as DEFINE, except that it CONSes its
function into a LIST and returns that changed into a MACRO.  Eventually
macros will be able to be compiled and <1 <-a compiled macro>- > will be
an RSUBR.
	Macros really exhibit their advantages when they are compiled.
The compiler will simply cause the first evaluation to occur and compile
the result.  The new subr EXPAND exists for this purpose and for the
purpose of debugging macros.  It takes a macro form and returns the expansion.

4)	Interpreter SPECIAL and UNSPECIAL checking.

	One of the most common user compiler bugs is forgetting to DECL
an atom to be SPECIAL, because up to now there has been no way of making
the interpreter do SPECIAL checking.  MUDDLE 49 attempts to solve this
problem.  The user may put his MUDDLE into a mode where normal SPECIAL
checking is performed at run time.  This feature may at any time be
disabled, and the MUDDLE will act like previous MUDDLEs and treat all
local values as SPECIALs.  The user may also specify whether normal mode
is SPECIAL or UNSPECIAL.  Two new SUBRs exist to handle this:

	<SPECIAL-CHECK <-false or non-false>- >

turns checking on and off and returns the old state.  If it is called
with no arguments, it simply returns the current state.

	<SPECIAL-MODE <-SPECIAL or UNSPECIAL>- >

sets the normal mode and returns the previous mode.  It may also be called
with no arguments.

5)	GDECL and MANIFEST

	GDECL and MANIFEST have been implemented in the interpreter in an
attempt to narrow the differences between compiled and interpreted code.
Both have the same calling sequences as the corresponding functions in
the compiler.  The checking is only done when DECL checking is being done
(see DECL-CHECK).

6)	GET-DECL and PUT-DECL

	These two subrs permit the DECL of a global or local value to
be examined and changed.  GET-DECL takes a locative to a local or global
value (#LOCD) and returns either the decl, false if there is none or the atom
MANIFEST.  PUT-DECL takes a locative and a new DECL which can't be false
or MANIFEST.

7)	DISMISS

	DISMISS permits an interrupt handler to return an arbitrary value
to an arbitrary activation at an arbitrary interrupt level.  The call is
as follows:

	<DISMISS <-value>- -<-activation>-- -<-int-level>-- >

where only the value is required.  If activation is omitted, return is
to the place interrupted from.  If int-level is omitted, the int-level
prior to the current interrupt is restored.

8)	RUNTIME and REALTIME interrupts

	The RUNTIME interrupt causes an interrupt to happen when the
specified amount of run time has occurred.  The REALTIME interrupt
causes an interrupt every time the specified amount of time has elapsed
(for example, every 10 seconds).
	To enable these interrupts, call ON or EVENT of "RUNT" or "REALT".
The interrupt functions should take no arguments in either case.
	To set the time periods for either interrupt, call RUNTIMER or
REALTIMER with the number of seconds (fix or float).

9)	PARITY interrupt

	A new interrupt that is fatal if not handled has been implemented.
It occurs if a user-mode parity error occurs in the MUDDLE.  It is fatal
during garbage collection.

10)	Garbage Channels

	MUDDLE will now automatically close any CHANNELs not pointed to
by anything except CHANLIST.  This must for obvious reasons occur only
during garbage collection.

11)	Change to MEMBER

	If the second argument to MEMBER is a string, the first arg may
be either a character or another string.  If the first argument is a
string, a substring search is done by MEMBER.

12)	SLEEP and HANG changes

	SLEEP and HANG both take an optional second argument.  It is
evaluated every time an interrupt occurs and is dismissed back into the
SLEEP or HANG.  If the result of the evaluation is not FALSE, the result
is returned as the value of the SLEEP or HANG.

13)	Changes to FRAME, ARGS and FUNCT

	All three of these may now take a process as the argument.  They
return the top frame, args tuple or function name of the process.  If
the process is the current one, they return the current frame etc.
